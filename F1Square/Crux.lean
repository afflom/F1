F1 square — the CRUX, stated as faithfully as this substrate allows.

This module states the open crux precisely and ties it to the proved Template (P1). Discipline
(the program stance): the honesty layer is a VERIFIER, not a prohibition. We do not forbid a
proof of the crux; we forbid fooling ourselves — and the sharpest safeguard here is the
faithfulness caution made explicit below.

  • `HodgeIndex P` is the §1.5 property: the form is `> 0` on the ample class and
    negative-definite on the primitive complement `H^⊥`.
  • `template_hodgeIndex` PROVES `HodgeIndex` for the product-of-curves Template — genuine, and
    [CLASSICAL] on a real surface over a field. So the PROPERTY is real and provable.
  • The CRUX is `HodgeIndex` for the arithmetic square `𝕊 = Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ` (companion
    §1.5 / T5). It is OPEN, and here is the faithful reason it is not just a corollary of the
    Template:

    FAITHFULNESS CAUTION. The crux is `HodgeIndex` on the realization of `𝕊` WHOSE PAIRING
    CARRIES THE SPECTRAL DATA. Do NOT define the crux as a loose existential
    `∃ P, HodgeIndex P` — that is witnessed by the Template and is classically TRUE, hence is
    NOT RH. Moreover a faithful statement of RH via the zeta zeros needs ℂ and ζ; the
    equivalence between the geometric `HodgeIndex` on `𝕊` and the analytic RH is [CLASSICAL].

    v0.17.0 UPDATE (stage C) — the caution now has a sharper, PROVEN form. Canonical `𝕊` IS
    constructed at the monoid-scheme level (`Square/Tensor.lean`, universal property proved),
    its intersection lattice is DERIVED from point counts (`Square/Lattice.lean`), and the
    Hodge index HOLDS for that derived lattice (`Square.square_hodgeIndex` — a genuine,
    audited theorem on `𝕊`'s own polarized instance `Square.squarePolarized`; per the program
    stance that is a result, not a defect). But that lattice is provably PENCIL-BLIND
    (`Square.square_hodge_pencil_blind`): `[Γ_n] = [Δ]` and `Δ·Γ_n = 0` for ALL `n` — the
    trace data `Δ·Γ_q = q+1−a` through which the function-field mechanism
    (`Mechanism.hodgeType`) forces RH-for-curves is ABSENT from it; on `𝕊` the arithmetic
    content relocated to the real shift lengths `log n` (`Square/Pencil.lean`), i.e. to the
    spectral side (companion T4: the `H¹` on which scaling acts with spectrum = the zeros).
    A Hodge index that holds with NO spectral input says nothing about the spectrum — the
    geometric face of the §2.3 control (`Bridge.control_psd`). THEREFORE the crux is
    `HodgeIndex` for the `H¹`-BEARING pairing (where `Δ·Γ` carries the trace), equivalently
    Weil positivity / `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` (`Li.LiCrux`) — NOT realized in this substrate; stating
    that equivalence faithfully is the v0.18.0 bridge, and `hodgeIndexHolds` stays `none`.

    OPEN: that realization is not constructed here, and its `HodgeIndex` is neither proved nor
    axiomatized. Two instances ARE proved and are NOT the crux: the product-of-curves template
    (`template_hodgeIndex`, a classical fact about a different object) and — since v0.17.0 —
    canonical `𝕊`'s coarse numerical lattice (`Square.square_hodgeIndex`), which is provably
    pencil-blind (`Square.square_hodge_pencil_blind`: no spectral input, hence no bearing on
    RH). The specificity — the SAME property on the SPECTRAL pairing — is the open content. -/
