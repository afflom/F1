F1 square — v0.21.0 stage G, brick **crux frontier `n = 3`**: the next conquerable coefficient of
the coupling, pinned to the concrete closed form `λ₃`.

`atlas_crux_localization` reduced closing the crux in the Atlas to the prime–archimedean coupling
sign `arith(n)+arch(n) > 0` for all `n` — conquered at `n = 1, 2`. The NEXT coefficient is `n = 3`,
and this brick pins it exactly: for η-data anchored through `η₂` (the `γ₂`-bearing third anchor), the
coupling at `n = 3` is positive iff the concrete closed form `Rlambda3` is positive
(`coupling_n3_iff_pos_lambda3`, via `genuineLam_three`). So the `n = 3` conquest IS `Pos Rlambda3`.

WHAT REMAINS (the open numeric frontier, honestly). `Rlambda3 ≈ 0.2076` (the standard Li value),
with `λ₃^arith ≈ +1.22` and `λ₃^∞ ≈ −1.013` — an absolute margin ≈ 0.21, NOT razor-thin. But the
closed form has HEAVY cancellation (the archimedean block `−(3/2)log4π + (9/4)ζ(2) − (7/8)ζ(3) ≈
−3.80 + 3.70 − 1.05` collapses three `Θ(3.8)` constants to `Θ(1)`), so a `Pos Rlambda3` certificate
needs ALL of `γ, γ₁, γ₂, ζ(2), ζ(3), log 4π` to ~0.1–0.3% RELATIVE precision at once. The DOMINANT
loss is `γ₁`, not `γ`: `−6γ₁` is `+0.437` truly, but the existing `γ₁ ≤ −0.0445` (`Rgamma1_le_neg445`)
yields only `+0.267` — burning 0.17 of the margin, an order of magnitude too loose vs. the true
`−0.0728`. The repo has `γ` two-sided (`Rgamma_h_lower/upper`), `γ₁` upper (loose), `γ₂` lower
(`Rgamma2_ge_neg002`), `ζ(2)` lower (`zeta2_lower`), partial `ζ(3)`. STILL MISSING: a TIGHT two-sided
`γ₁` (the bottleneck), a `γ₂` UPPER bound, a `ζ(2)` UPPER bound, and a two-sided `ζ(3)` — each a
`GammaTwoBracket`-scale construction. See the precision analysis in `Analysis/LambdaThree.lean`.

This is genuine progress (the `n = 3` target is now a single concrete `Pos Rlambda3`), and it is
HONEST about the boundary: extending `n` one coefficient at a time conquers more ground but never
closes the crux, which is `∀ n` (= RH); that uniform bound is the irreducible content. The crux
fields stay `none`.

/-- **The `n = 3` coupling is exactly `Pos Rlambda3`** (for η-data anchored through `η₂`): through
    `genuineLam_three` (the closed form meets the ladder at `n = 3`), the coupling
    `arith(3) + arch(3)` is positive iff the concrete closed form `Rlambda3` is. So the next
