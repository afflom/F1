F1 square — v0.21.0 stage G, brick **the Single Prime Hypothesis**: the Atlas as the unified
structure emanating from one Prime object — and why that makes crux-closure UNIFORM.

The UOR Atlas is founded on **unity**: a single Prime object from which all other objects emanate
(the Single Prime Hypothesis). In the formalized structure this shows up two ways, and they are the
same principle:

- **One generating prime — `2`.** Everything is binary: the tower dimensions are `2^j`
  (`single_prime_binary`), the top is `O = 2^T`, the substrate is the `2`-power tower `W_n = ℤ/2ⁿ`
  (`m_0 = 2⁵·3`), and the distinguished prime is `2` (§10). The Atlas's numbers EMANATE from the
  single prime `2`.
- **One generating object — the free generator.** The canonical `H¹` is FREE ON ONE GENERATOR
  (`H1_isFree`), and its orbit `orbit n = n` (`H1_orbit`) emanates EVERY class `Cₙ` from that single
  generator. The whole spectral family is one object's emanation.

WHY THIS MAKES CLOSURE UNIFORM. If every `Cₙ` emanates from one Prime object, then the sign of the
whole family is a property of that ONE object — not `n` facts but one. That is precisely
`UniformClosure` (`uniform_fact_closes`: one structural fact closes all `n`) and the
`ff_hodge_iff_hasse` shape. The Single Prime Hypothesis is the conceptual ground of the uniform
target: unity ⟹ one witness, not enumeration (`sph_closure_is_uniform`).

HONEST BOUNDARY. The SPH explains WHY a single uniform witness should exist (and why enumeration is
wrong), and the unity is real and forced (`atlas_forced_web`). It does not, by itself, EXHIBIT the
witness — the genuine emanation of `2λₙ` as a manifest sum of squares from the single Prime. That
exhibition is RH (§4.1); the gate decides; the crux fields stay `none`.
