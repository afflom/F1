F1 square — v0.22.0 Track 2, the crux frontier: **the Sonine projection — Weil positivity recovered
on the complement of the negative-multiplier band.**

THE FRONTIER, NAMED. The natural finite routes to the crux are foreclosed: component isolation is
RH-equivalent (neither `arith(n)` nor `arch(n)` is unconditionally positive — `arch(1) < 0`); pointwise
single-place positivity is REFUTED (`BurnolAlphaTwo.burnol_multiplier_indefinite`: `α(0) > 0`, `α(2) < 0`);
free algebraic sum-of-squares is RH-equivalent (`WeilPSD.realizesDiag_genuine_iff`: an SOS for `2λₙ` IS
RH). What is LEFT STANDING is not a component and not a pointwise value but a **projection**: the
positivity of the *whole* Weil pairing recovered on the Sonine complement — the Connes–Consani / Burnol
resolution.

THE CONSTRUCTION (extrapolated from the proven `α`-indefiniteness and the Atlas signature geometry).
The Weil pairing on autocorrelations is the spectral (multiplier) form `Σ_τ α(τ)·|g(τ)|²` with `α`
Burnol's archimedean multiplier — PROVEN indefinite (`α(0) > 0`, `α(2) < 0`). Diagonalized on the
spectral indices it is `multForm α`, `(multForm α)(i,j) = δ_{ij}·α(i)`. Then:

- **The whole form is positive iff there is no negative band** (`multForm_psd_iff`): `WeilPSD (multForm α)
  ⟺ α(i) ≥ 0 ∀i`. For Burnol's `α` the right side is FALSE (`α(2) < 0`), so the bare pairing is
  indefinite (`burnol_pairing_indefinite`) — the single-place obstruction, in form-positivity terms.
- **Positivity is recovered, UNCONDITIONALLY, on the Sonine complement** (`multForm_psd_on_complement`):
  if a test family `c` vanishes on the negative band (`c(i) = 0` wherever `α(i) < 0`), then
  `Σ c_i c_j (multForm α)(i,j) = Σ_i c_i² α(i) ≥ 0` — a THEOREM, no RH. `burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine`
  is the Burnol instance: with `c(1) = 0` (projecting out the `α(2) < 0` band index), the pairing is
  `≥ 0` using `α(0) > 0` on the complement.

WHAT IS UNCONDITIONAL vs WHAT IS RH. The Sonine-complement positivity (`...on_complement`,
`...on_sonine`) is unconditional — a genuine theorem. The FULL positivity (over *all* test families,
including those with energy in the negative band) is `WeilPSD (multForm α)` = `α ≥ 0 ∀i` (the bare
multiplier nonneg), which is FALSE pointwise; the genuine RH content is that the negative band's
contribution is cancelled by the coupling of `f` and its transform `f̂` (the Sonine *space* constraint,
which couples the two and is NOT captured by the bare support condition here). This file builds the
projection MECHANISM and the unconditional complement-positivity; the band-coupling that would extend it
to the whole space is RH, and stays open — the crux fields stay `none`.

(Faithfulness boundary: the genuine Connes–Consani Sonine space is the `f, f̂` co-support condition, an
infinite-dimensional coupling; `c(i) = 0 on the band` is its spectral-support skeleton, which is what
the discrete, integration-free substrate carries. The unconditional positivity proved here is the
band-complement positivity, not the full Sonine-space theorem.)

    squares `Σ c_i² α(i)` nonnegative (`multForm_psd_on_complement` with no projection). -/

    `WeilPSD`, because its negative band `α(2) < 0` (index `1`) is a negative diagonal entry. This is
    the single-place obstruction (`burnol_multiplier_indefinite`) read as failure of full
    form-positivity — exactly why a projection, not a pointwise bound, is needed. -/

    nonnegative pairing, for every truncation `N` — using `α(0) > 0` on the complement. Positivity is
    recovered by the PROJECTION, with no RH input. The crux (extending it to test families with energy
    in the band, via the genuine Sonine `f↔f̂` coupling) stays open. -/

    (`burnol_pairing_indefinite`, the negative band is real), but positivity IS recovered on the
    Sonine complement (`burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine`, unconditional). So what closes the crux is
    neither a component nor a pointwise value: it is the projection — and the open content is the
    coupling that would carry the band-complement positivity to the whole space (RH). The crux fields
    stay `none`. -/
