F1 square — v0.18.0 stage D, brick 4: **THE CRUX ATTEMPT, under the gate** — run, recorded,
and honestly concluded. RH stays OPEN; the crux fields stay `none`.

THE ATTEMPT (ROADMAP stage D: "the Hodge-index / Li-positivity attempt on canonical 𝕊 under
the gate — fields flip none → some true iff a genuine, audited, axiom-clean proof lands").
With the bridge in place (`crux_faces_equivalent`: the geometric and analytic faces are the
same proposition), the attempt is on `λₙ > 0 ∀ n ≥ 1`. What this program can certify today,
it has certified:

  • `n = 1`: `Pos λ₁` (v0.14.0, `Rlambda1_pos`, `λ₁ ≈ 0.0231`) — via the accelerated
    Euler–Mascheroni bracket `γ ∈ [0.54, 0.66]` and the kernel-certified logs.
  • `n = 2`: `Pos λ₂` (v0.16.0, `Rlambda2_pos`; certified lower bound `λ₂ ≥ 0.0043` —
    razor-thin as a BOUND; the true value is `λ₂ ≈ 0.0923457`) — via the parabola trick
    for `γ − γ²`, the γ₁ bracket (`Rgamma1_le_neg445`, the program's hardest analytic
    mechanization), `ζ(2) ≥ 1.63`, `log 4π ≤ 2.5316`.
  • Both transfer to the geometric face through the bridge (`spectral_evidence_two`:
    `⟨C₁,C₁⟩ < 0`, `⟨C₂,C₂⟩ < 0`), and the up-to-2 strict negativity is packaged below
    (`spectral_strict_upTo_two`).

THE FRONTIER, made exact (`crux_attempt_frontier`): given the two certified slices, the
crux is EQUIVALENT to `∀ n ≥ 3, λₙ > 0`. The next certifiable slice (`λ₃`) needs the second
Stieltjes constant `γ₂` — now BUILT (v0.20.0, `Rgamma2`) with its numeric bracket `γ₂ ≥ −0.02`
CLOSED (`Rgamma2_ge_neg002`); the `λ₃` positivity certificate further needs the full
`λ₃`-formula numeric assembly (`λ₃ ≈ 0.2076` is a heavily-cancelled combination of `Θ(1)` terms,
`γ₁` binding — see `Analysis/LambdaThree.lean`), and each
further slice needs the next `γⱼ`. No finite run reaches the crux (`liPositive_iff_all_upTo`,
`spectral_iff_all_upTo`) — the universal `∀ n` is the open content. (v0.19.0 made the
universal's shape exact on the dominance face: `crux_closure_route` — this certified head
plus ONE tail bound, a single sequence dominating the arithmetic oscillation strictly below
the archimedean trend from `n = 3` on, yields the crux; the tail bound for the genuine
parts is the single remaining object, provably equivalent to this frontier.)

WHY NO GENERAL ROUTE CLOSED (the attempt's honest post-mortem, with the program's own
controls as evidence):
  • Manifestly-positive routes are VACUOUS: any kernel of the form `Σ cos·cos + sin·sin`
    is PSD for an arbitrary real spectrum (`Bridge.control_psd`, the §2.3 control) — its
    positivity is equivalent to the spectrum being real, i.e. it IS the conclusion.
  • The coarse geometry of canonical `𝕊` cannot see the crux: its lattice Hodge index
    holds AND is pencil-blind (`Square.square_hodge_pencil_blind`) — no spectral input.
  • Finite certification cannot reach it: `spectralTwoSlice_not_crux` PROVES the
    two-slice instance fails the crux — positivity of any finite batch of `λₙ` (the
    literature's `n ≤ 10⁵`) is not the theorem.
  • The BL decomposition relocates, not removes, the difficulty: `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}`
    with opposite-sign parts (`li_decomposition_two_realized` realizes it at `n = 1, 2`);
    positivity is a CANCELLATION statement (companion `missing_object_over_Q.md` §8.1), and
    positivity reformulations do not make RH easier (Conrey–Li, IMRN 2000; the de Branges
    precedent, companion §2.1).
  • What WOULD close it: the genuine spectral instance — the `H¹` pairing with spectrum =
    the zeta zeros (T4/§3.4, the Hilbert–Pólya face; Connes–Consani's archimedean Weil
    positivity, Selecta Math. 27 (2021) — unconditional for test support in
    `[2^{−1/2}, 2^{1/2}]`, exactly the range excluding every prime — is the strongest
    partial result, and global is exactly what is open).
  • An open question OF THE LITERATURE (not just of this program): whether positivity of
    ALL finite-rank truncations of the Weil form alone is equivalent to RH in general —
    Bombieri (2000) covers the finitely-many-off-line-zeros case (negative eigenvalues of
    a large truncation count half the off-line zeros); the general density question has
    no verified published answer. The finite-check guards above are therefore not merely
    prudence; they reflect the genuine state of the art.

CONCLUSION OF THE ATTEMPT: no genuine, audited, axiom-clean proof of the universal landed.
Per the bright line, `hodgeIndexHolds` and `liPositivityHolds` STAY `none`; the release
ships the bridge substrate. This module is the attempt's record — honest, mechanized where
mechanizable, and explicit about the single remaining object.

THE ATTEMPT IS NOT BIASED TOWARD FAILURE (the verifier-not-prohibition stance, enforced in
BOTH directions): (i) the geometric crux property is SATISFIABLE — `spectral_template_crux`
proves it for the constant-`1` instance, so the encoding contains no hidden impossibility
and openness is a fact about the genuine instance, not an artifact of the formulation;
(ii) the certified-slice ladder is EXTENSIBLE — nothing here caps it at `n = 2`: building
the `γ₂` bracket (the same dyadic machinery as `GammaOne`) would certify `λ₃`, and so on,
arbitrarily far; (iii) the gate is two-sided — `crux_attempt_frontier` is stated as the
precise NEXT TARGET, and if a genuine proof of the universal ever lands here, the fields
flip to `some true` because that is then the truth (a result, not a defect). What is
recorded above is where the wall genuinely is, not a declaration that it cannot fall.

/-- **The attempt's exact frontier**: for any spectral square whose first two Li slices are
    certified positive (as the genuine instance's are, via `Rlambda1_pos`/`Rlambda2_pos`),
    the crux is equivalent to the positivity of the slices from `n = 3` on. This is the
    precise statement of where the v0.18.0 attempt stands — the certified part is done,
