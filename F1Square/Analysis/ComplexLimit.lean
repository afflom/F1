F1 square — **complex convergence**: `CReg`, `Clim`, `CTendsTo`, completeness, uniqueness, and the
limit congruence, lifted coordinatewise from the constructive-real completeness (`Complete.lean`,
`RlimProps.lean`).

Track 1 needs the completed `ξ` and its analytic properties (the Hadamard product, the
`CSpougeGamma → Γ` convergence as a `Ceq`, the log-derivative series). All of those are limits over
ℂ, and `ℂ = ℝ × ℝ` with componentwise Bishop equality (`Complex.lean`), so a sequence of complex
numbers converges iff both real-component sequences converge — a clean coordinatewise lift of the
v0.7.0 real completeness brick.  This file is that lift: it provides the substrate (`Clim`,
`CTendsTo`, completeness `Clim_tendsTo`, uniqueness `CTendsTo_unique`, congruence `Clim_congr`) on
which the complex series and infinite products of the remaining Track-1 stack are built.
