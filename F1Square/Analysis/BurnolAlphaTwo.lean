F1 square — **the Burnol multiplier off-center: `α(2) < 0`** (the multiplier is indefinite).

Building on the completed kernel-value infrastructure (`ψ(1/4) ≤ −4`, `Σ cₙ(1) ≤ 4.22`, `log π ≥ 1`,
`h₊(2) < 0`), this supplies the last missing coefficient bound — `√2 ≤ 3/2` — via the exp∘log
inverse `Rexp_RlogNat`, and assembles the full pointwise statement.

THE √2 BOUND. `sqrt2 = exp(½·log 2)` (no sqrt primitive). `sqrt2² = exp(½·log2 + ½·log2) =
exp(log 2) = 2` (`RrpowPos_add` + `Rexp_RlogNat 2`, since `RlogNat 2 = RlogPos (ofQ 2) 0` is exactly
`sqrt2`'s logarithm up to proof-irrelevance). Then `√2 ≤ 3/2` from `2 ≤ 9/4` and `Rle_of_Rmul_self_le`.

THE INDEFINITENESS. Burnol's multiplier `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ log2)/(1+4τ²) + h₊(τ)`,
`h₊(τ) = Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2) − log π`. At `τ = 2`: `|cos| ≤ 1`, `8√2 ≤ 12`, `1/(1+16) = 1/17`, so the
oscillating term is `≤ 12/17 ≈ 0.706`; and `h₊(2) ≤ 0.22 − 1 = −0.78`. Hence `α(2) ≤ 12/17 − 0.78 < 0`.

This mechanizes Burnol's observation that `α` is NOT pointwise non-negative (the "further idea seems
necessary"), and Connes–Consani's need for the Sonine-space projection — the obstruction to extending
the single-archimedean-place positivity, now a theorem. It is the barrier, NOT a route through it;
the crux fields stay `none`.
