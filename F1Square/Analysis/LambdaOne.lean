F1 square — the **first Li/Keiper coefficient** `λ₁` as a **positivity-certified** constructive real.

By the Bombieri–Lagarias formula, the first Li coefficient is the *closed-form constant*

  λ₁ = 1 + γ/2 − ½·log(4π)

(no zeros, no higher Stieltjes constants enter). The numerical value is `λ₁ ≈ 0.0231` — positive,
consistent with the Riemann hypothesis (Li's criterion: RH ⇔ λₙ > 0 ∀ n).

Here `λ₁` is assembled from the **convergence-accelerated** Euler–Mascheroni constant `Rgamma_h`
(harmonic-telescoped, with the kernel-certified lower bracket `γ ≥ 0.54`) and the clean
rational-argument logs `Rlog2c` (`log 2 ≤ 0.6931`) and `Rlogπc` (`log π ≤ 1.1453`, via the tight
Machin bracket `π ≤ 3.142`). With those bounds, `λ₁` is bracketed below by `c ≈ 0.0042 > 0`, so

  **`Rlambda1_pos : Pos Rlambda1`**

is a genuine, choice-free, kernel-checkable certificate that `λ₁ > 0` — built from first principles
(no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`). This realizes the `n = 1` slice of Li's criterion as
**evidence**, NOT as the crux: it does not assert `λₙ > 0` for all `n` (that is RH, which stays open;
`liPositivityHolds` remains `none`).

We prove positivity through `2λ₁ = 2 + γ − log(4π)` (integer coefficients, so no halving is needed in
the bound), then halve once at the end (`Rhalf`, which preserves positivity).

Pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free.
