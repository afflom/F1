F1 square — the first analysis brick: exact rationals ℚ, built the UOR way (Thrust C).

Per the standing directive, the analytic substrate is built from first principles on the UOR
pattern (canonical form + exact arithmetic + realization), NOT imported from Mathlib. This is brick
one: exact rationals from ℤ, whose **canonical form is reduce-to-lowest-terms** — ℚ's content-address
(the uor-addr κ, one level down): two fractions mean the same number iff they share a canonical form.
Pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`.

Scope (honest): the TYPE, the OPERATIONS, the canonical form, and DECIDABLE exact equality/order are
built and verified; these already give exact cycle-means and exact signature comparisons. The
*general* field axioms and general idempotence of `reduce` need a commutative-ring normalizer for ℤ
(there is no `ring` tactic without Mathlib) — that normalizer is itself a UOR-consistent analysis
tool and is the first task of the v0.3.0 analysis work. Here the laws are verified concretely.

Roadmap (one brick per release): ℚ (here) → constructive ℝ (Cauchy-with-modulus / intervals) → ℂ +
transcendentals (exp/log/cos via convergent series with rigorous error bounds) → ζ and λₙ as
exact-bounded objects. Each brick makes more of the analytic half statable and checkable — never the
crux (proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH).
