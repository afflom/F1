F1 square — the λₙ / Riemann-Hypothesis PROOF BOUNDARY, stated as faithfully as this substrate
allows (the v0.10.0 milestone: lock the proof boundary before building ζ).

This is the analytic face of the same crux that `Crux.lean` states geometrically. By **Li's criterion**
(Xian-Jin Li, *J. Number Theory* 65 (1997), 325–333), the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the
positivity of the Li coefficients:

    RH  ⟺  λₙ > 0   for all n ≥ 1,        λₙ := Σ_ρ [ 1 − (1 − 1/ρ)ⁿ ]   (paired sum over the
                                          nontrivial zeros ρ of ζ; equivalently the derivative form
                                          λₙ = (1/(n−1)!) dⁿ/dsⁿ[ sⁿ⁻¹ log ξ(s) ]|_{s=1}).

So `∀ n ≥ 1, λₙ > 0` IS RH. (For ζ the criterion is the **strict** `> 0`; the **non-strict** `≥ 0`
form is the general Bombieri–Lagarias multiset criterion — *Complements to Li's Criterion for the
Riemann Hypothesis*, *J. Number Theory* 77 (1999), 274–287 — and is likewise equivalent to RH. We
state both faces.) This module pins that boundary HONESTLY.

  • `Rnonneg x` is the Bishop "x ≥ 0" on our constructive reals; `Pos` (already in `Analysis.Real`) is
    the strict "x > 0". Both are genuine (witnessed by `0`, `1`).
  • `LiPositive lam` is the strict property `∀ n ≥ 1, Pos (lam n)`; `LiNonneg lam` the non-strict
    `∀ n ≥ 1, Rnonneg (lam n)`. `template_liPositive` / `template_liNonneg` PROVE them for a concrete
    (constant) sequence — so the properties are real and satisfiable.
  • THE CRUX is `LiPositive` for the genuine ζ-derived Li sequence (companion §1.5 / T5, analytic face).
    It is OPEN, and here is the faithful reason it is not a corollary of the template:

    FAITHFULNESS CAUTION. The crux is `LiPositive` on the SPECIFIC sequence `λ` of Li coefficients of
    ζ — which is uniquely determined by ζ but is not constructed in this substrate (it needs ζ, the
    explicit formula, and ℂ — not built here). Do NOT:
      (a) define the crux as `∃ lam, LiPositive lam` — witnessed by the constant `1` sequence
          (`template_liPositive`), TRUE, and NOT RH;
      (b) substitute the template, a square, `|·|`, a sum of squares, or any manifestly-positive
          expression for the genuine `λ` (positivity must be a theorem about the ζ-zero sum, not a
          syntactic property of the definition);
      (c) mistake a FINITE check for the theorem: the first ~10⁵ Li coefficients are numerically
          positive (computed to n = 100 000, Feb 2025), so `LiPositiveUpTo lam N` holds for every
          checkable `N` — but `LiPositive lam = ∀ N, LiPositiveUpTo lam N` (`liPositive_iff_all_upTo`),
          and no finite `N` (no `decide` over `n < N`) delivers the universal;
      (d) use a TRUNCATED `λ` (a finite zero-sum) as the object — those truncations can be all-positive
          while the limit's positivity is still exactly RH.
    The equivalence `LiPositive λ ⟺ RH` is itself [CLASSICAL] (Li 1997); and positivity reformulations
    do **not** make RH easier — they relocate, not remove, the difficulty (Conrey–Li, *IMRN* 2000).
    Therefore `LiCrux` below is parameterized by the (unconstructed) genuine sequence; we neither
    construct it, nor assert `LiPositive λ`, nor axiomatize it. If such a `λ` is one day built here and
    `LiPositive λ` proved (axiom-clean, audited), that is RH — a result, not a defect.

  • The substrate the ζ-layer must realize is stated as honest INTERFACES (never asserted for the
    genuine `λ`): `LiDecomposition` (Bombieri–Lagarias `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}`),
    `ExplicitFormulaTrace` (the Weil explicit formula as a trace; Weil 1952, Connes 1999), and
    `LiAgreesWith` (`computed = classical Li`). Each is shown genuine/inhabited; the real instances
    need ζ and — crucially — do NOT bear on positivity.

  • The Li coefficients are typed as `λ : Nat → ExactBoundedReal` (a stream of certified-enclosure
    reals, `Analysis.ExactBounded`). ζ at integer `s ≥ 2` is built as a *concrete* such object
    (`Analysis.zeta`, `Σ 1/iˢ` with the rigorous tail bound `zetadiff_bound`); the genuine ζ-derived
    `λ` (which needs analytic continuation, the explicit formula, and `log`) is the deferred input the
    interfaces above are stated against — its *values* are not fabricated here.
